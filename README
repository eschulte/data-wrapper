Wrap text data in a portable shell script allowing easy (re)-analysis

- Well suited to tabular or relational data with multiple categories.
- A nice way to share data (similar to Reproducible Research).
- Easier than continually re-learning how to do simple analysis tasks.

Usage:
1. Run the data-wrapper on your file of raw data passing in names for
   each column of the data.  Run "data-wrapper -h" to see detailed
   help.

     data-wrapper DATAFILE [COLUMNS]

2. This will result in the creation of an executable file named
   DATAFILE-viewer.  This file holds all of your data wrapped in a
   bash script which provides numerous views into the data.  For more
   information pass "-h" to this resulting script.

   Here's example help output from a data file I'm using currently.

     $ neut-viewer -h   
     Usage: neut-viewer [options...] [action]

     Options:
      -h --help ------------- print this help message
      -i --include COL=STR -- only include items with COL=STR in results
      -e --exclude COL=STR -- exclude items with COL=STR from results
      -b --by [COL,...] ----- group results by COLs (comma separated)
      -r --res [COL,...] ---- print results for COLs
                              (comma separated, defaults to neutral)
      -g --graph ------------ graph mean of results (requires feedgnuplot)
      -o --output FILE ------ save output to FILE

     Actions (specify at most one to reduce results):
      -m --mean ------------- mean of all matching results
      -s --sum -------------- mean of all matching results
      -t --t-test ----------- t test between all groups of results
                              (use at most one category, requires Rscript)
      -k --ks-test ---------- Kolomogorov-Smirnov between all groups of
                              results (at most one category, Rscript)

     Columns (COL):
      One of algorithm, language, compiler, flag, neutral.  Substrings may be
      used, e.g., "a" for "algorithm".

     Examples:

       to print a table of the mean value by algo and lang, use:

         neut-viewer -b algo,lang -m

       to calculate the total value by algo, and graph the results to an
       svg file, use:

         neut-viewer -b algo -m -g -o /tmp/by-lang.svg
