* Tasks [12/13]
** TODO regressions
Make it possible to fit regressions, shouldn't be hard with R.

For bonus points, graph the data and the regression line with gnuplot.

** DONE more simple metrics
- stdev
- min
- max

** DONE test suite and example page
Small file of example data, and a simple test file which
1. runs through some actions
2. verifies both lack of errors and valid output
3. saves the test session for display as an example page

** DONE switch from feedgnuplot to gnuplot
1. removes the least widely installed dependency
2. provides for more flexibility in producing graphical results

** DONE graphs for multiple-category output [2/2]
- [X] [[file:data-wrapper::error%20"TODO:%203D%20graphs%20for%20multiple%20categories."][file:data-wrapper::error "TODO: 3D graphs for multiple categories."]]
- [X] [[file:data-wrapper::error%20"TODO:%20clustered%20histograms%20for%20multiple%20categories."][file:data-wrapper::error "TODO: clustered histograms for multiple categories."]]

** DONE unify the =act= and =r_test= action methods
There should be only one way to apply actions, and it should act on
only one style of data; that output by the =res= method, possibly with
temporary ACT values.

** DONE compress the data and uuencode
First check to see at what data size this starts to be an improvement.

** DONE don't assume unique column names
Instead of assuming the first letter of every column is unique,
actually calculate the unique prefixes.

** DONE handle multiple named results as well as named columns
- The last result should be the default.
- requires more command line options and correlate -h output
- no differentiating between independent/dependent variable columns

** DONE add tests for normal distributions
Shapiro-Wilk test.

** DONE add correlation tests
** DONE R cleanup
When adding more T tests, also switch to using R for transposes rather
than including the awk transpose function.

** DONE add support for Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests
