* Tasks [7/9]
** TODO switch from feedgnuplot to gnuplot
1. removes the least widely installed dependency
2. provides for more flexibility in producing graphical results

** DONE unify the =act= and =r_test= action methods
There should be only one way to apply actions, and it should act on
only one style of data; that output by the =res= method, possibly with
temporary ACT values.

** TODO compress the data and uuencode
First check to see at what data size this starts to be an improvement.

** DONE don't assume unique column names
Instead of assuming the first letter of every column is unique,
actually calculate the unique prefixes.

** DONE handle multiple named results as well as named columns
- The last result should be the default.
- requires more command line options and correlate -h output
- no differentiating between independent/dependent variable columns

** DONE add tests for normal distributions
Shapiro-Wilk test.

** DONE add correlation tests
** DONE R cleanup
When adding more T tests, also switch to using R for transposes rather
than including the awk transpose function.

** DONE add support for Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests
