* Tasks [5/6]
** TODO don't assume unique column names
Instead of assuming the first letter of every column is unique,
actually calculate the unique prefixes.

** DONE handle multiple named results as well as named columns
- The last result should be the default.
- requires more command line options and correlate -h output
- no differentiating between independent/dependent variable columns

** DONE add tests for normal distributions
Shapiro-Wilk test.

** DONE add correlation tests
** DONE R cleanup
When adding more T tests, also switch to using R for transposes rather
than including the awk transpose function.

** DONE add support for Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests
