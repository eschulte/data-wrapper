* Tasks [2/5]
** TODO don't assume unique column names
Instead of assuming the first letter of every column is unique,
actually calculate the unique prefixes.

** TODO handle multiple named results as well as named columns
- The first result should be the default.
- requires more command line options and correlate -h output

** TODO add tests for normal distributions
** DONE R cleanup
When adding more T tests, also switch to using R for transposes rather
than including the awk transpose function.

** DONE add support for Kolomogorov-Smirnov tests
